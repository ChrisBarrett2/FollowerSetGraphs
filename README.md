# FollowerSetGraphs
A Haskell program which generates follower set graphs for shift spaces given a set of forbidden words. See the attached poster for a definition of follower set graphs. 

Instructions:

1. Write the forbidden words in a list (each on one line).
2. Leave a line blank by pressing enter.
3. Receive the output data.

How to read the outputs:

There are two sets of outputs:
(a) Numbered lines (1, 2, 3, etc.) denoting each node.
Every node also carries the labels of the related follower sets.
(b) Triples (from, to, label) denoting the source the range and the label of each edge.

Note: Concatenation is on the right here.
You can pass from left to right simply by reversing the words.
